The Sample_AssetDefinitions files provided in this folder are examples that can be useful for exploring and providing feedback on this Technology Preview tool.

A new "Complex Element Option" is now included in any Asset Manager spreadsheets created using the 'Export Empty Asset Definition Template' button on the
Asset Manager dialog. Currently the software is not using this new option, it is being put in place for additional capabilities coming in a future release.
Both spreadsheets with and without this option will function the same at this time.


The configuration variable ITEMTYPE_LOOKUP must be defined pointing to the full path and file name of the Asset Management Lookup.xlsx file.

There is a recorded presentation available on the Learn Server that explains and demonstrates these spreadsheet files.
The presentation is located at https://learn.bentley.com/app/VideoPlayer/LinkToIndividualCourse?LearningPathID=112668&CourseId=127203&MediaID=5017577
